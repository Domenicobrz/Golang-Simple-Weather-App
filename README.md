# Golang-Simple-Weather-App
A quick example on how to process a request's IP address to show weather information in a very simple golang application
The app will use a GeoLite2.mmdb database to retrieve the location of a given IP address, which will be fed to a yahoo yql to retrieve weather info in the specified location

While this sample app wont be accurate enough for any serious project, it behaves well as a little webpage widget to show wheater info in non-https pages without requiring user input to communicate it's position
